Package 2 Method:
This method leverages the fuzzer’s statelessness by requiring a precise multi-byte input match that is extremely unlikely to occur randomly. This precise match bypasses typical fuzzer mutations.
How the code works:
- The code checks for a specific multi-byte sequence within the input
- Only when this exact sequence is present does the code proceed to trigger the crash behavior.
Obtaining Hardcoded Information:
- The required multi-byte sequence is hardcoded based on an analysis of the input requirements.
- This sequence was chosen to be long enough to evade common random mutations.
Critical Steps/Algorithms:
- Exact Sequence Matching: Uses a strict equality check for a multi-byte segment.
- Stateless Input Validation: The fuzzer’s lack of memory/state is exploited because it cannot easily build up to the required sequence over multiple iterations.
