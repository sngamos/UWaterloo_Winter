Package 4 Method:
This method takes advantage of the fuzzerâ€™s difficulty in producing inputs that satisfy precise, complex invariants. Here, the input must be an exact 1024-byte pattern consisting entirely of ones (0xFF or binary ones).
How the code works:
- The code checks if the input is exactly 1024 bytes long.
- It then verifies that every byte in the input is set to one.
- If both conditions are met, the code triggers the intended error condition (e.g., a crash).
Obtaining Hardcoded Information:
- The invariant (1024 bytes of ones) was determined through manual analysis and is hardcoded into the condition checks.
- This pattern is specifically chosen because it is statistically unlikely to occur through random mutations.
Critical Steps/Algorithms
- Length Verification: The code first checks that the input length is exactly 1024 bytes.
- Content Verification: It then iterates over each byte to confirm that they are all ones.
- Trigger Action: If both verifications pass, a crash is triggered.
