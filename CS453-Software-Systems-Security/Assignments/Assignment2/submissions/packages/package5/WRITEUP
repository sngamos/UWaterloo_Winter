Package 5 Method:
This method targets the fuzzer's difficulty in satisfying rigid, interdependent structural conditions. The code is designed to crash when it receives a 64 byte long palindrome input, which is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards.
How the code works:
- The program checks if the input string is 64 byte long, if less than 64 bytes, pad till 64 bytes long
- Compare corresponding characters from the start and end of the input, using input[i] - input[len(input)-i]
- For all 0 < i < n/2 values, sum up all the differences, if it is palindrome, the value of the sum = 0.
- trigger divide by 0 by doing 1/sum
Critical Steps/Algorithms:
- Palindrome Check: A loop (or two-pointer technique) is used to compare characters from both ends of the input.
- Interdependent Structure: The check inherently requires a relationship between all parts of the input, making it hard for random mutations to satisfy.
- Error Trigger: Upon confirming the input is a palindrome, the error condition is executed.
