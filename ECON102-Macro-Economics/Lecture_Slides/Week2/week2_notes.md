# Week 2 Notes

## System of National Accounts (SNA)

- Compiles accurate & systematic measures of aggregate economic activity of a antion or jurisdictional area.
- Sets up standardized measurement of macroeconomic vairables based on set of accounting principles
- Generates **GDP**

## Gross Domestic Product
- Used as a yardstick for growth
- the market value, (value of goods at market prices), of all final goods and services produced in an economy during a fixed period of time. 
- 3 ways to measure GDP
    1. **Product Approach**
        - Sum all ``FINAL`` good and services **produced** in the economy at their market value. 
        - **Excludes** intermediate prodcution to avoid double counting. 
    2. **Expenditure Approach**
        - Sum all `FINAL` goods & services **purchased** in the economy.
        - `GDP = C+I+G+NX`
            1. Personal Consumption Expenditure (C)  
                - Durable Goods
                - Semi-Durable goods
                - Nondurable goods
                - Services
                - **Only accounts for the good produced in the same period**
            2. Investment (I)
                - Residential Construction
                - Nonresidential Construction, Machinery & Equipment
                - Intellectual Property Products (IPP)
                - Business Inventory Investment
            3. Government Expenditure (G)
                - Government Purchases of Goods and Services
                - Government Investment
            4. Net Exports (NX)
                - Exports - Imports
                
        **Note:** If the good is producted in the previous period but only consumed in the current period, the consumption is excluded from **C**.
    3. Income Approach
        - Sum all income recieved by workers, the govnenment & firms. (wages, taxes, profits)
        - Detailed Income Approach:
            1. Labour Income
            2. Coporate Profits
            3. Interest and Investment income
            4. Unincorporated Business Income
                - net national income at factor cost
            5. Indirect Taxes less Subsidies
                - net national income at market prices
            6. Capital Consumption Allowance/Depreciation
- Fundamental Identity of National Income Accounting: 
    - **Total Production =  Total Expenditure =  Total Income**
    - Doesn't matter which method is used to calculate, but the GDP is always the same.
    - Each method only gives us different perspective on which component contribute the most to the economy's production activity.
- Issues with measuring GDP
    - Different countries measure their GDP differently, no 1 unified standard measure.
    - Sometimes it doesn't measure progress accurately.
    - Doesn't account for cost of resources and cost of pollution (costs of cleaning up environment due to economic activity)
    - Doesn't account for happiness
    - Doesn't account for unpaid childcare (mothers stay at home to take care of children)

## Gross National Product

**Net Factor Payment**  
Income earned abroad by a country's factors minus income earned in the country by foreign factor.

**GNP =  GDP + NFP**

## Saving Identities & Formulas

**Saving** = current income - current spending
