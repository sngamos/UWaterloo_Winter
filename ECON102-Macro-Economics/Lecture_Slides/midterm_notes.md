# Macro Economics Mid term notes

## Normative vs Positive Statements

Normative statements:
- About value judgments
- A opinionated statement about how something should be

Positive statements:
- About how something is actually in actual fact
- Statement that is purely factual without opinion

## System of National Account (SNA)
- Compile accurate and systematic measures of aggregate economic activity of nation or jurisdictional area, e.g GDP
- Set up standardized measurement of macroeconomic variables based on a set of accounting principles

## Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
The market value of all final goods and services produced in an economy during a fixed period of time.

market value: the value of goods at market price

### GDP calculation
1. Product Approach
    - Sum all `final` (i.e exclude all intermediate production to avoid double counting) goods and services produced in the economy at `market value`
2. Expenditure approach
    - Sum all final goods and services `purchased` in the economy 
    - GDP = C + I + G + NX
3. Income Approach
    - Sum all income received by workers, the government and firms. (Taxes, wage, profits)

Fundamental Identity of National Income Accounting
- Total Production = Total Expenditure = Total Income
- No matter which approach we use, we derive the same GDP
- Each method of measuring GDP give us a different perspective on which component contributes the most to an economy

### Issues with measuring GDP
- Might not be comparable across countries (different calculation methods)
- doesn't measure progress accurately
- doesn't take into account cost of pollution (overestimates)
- doesn't adequately capture quality or value
- doesn't measure happiness
- doesn't take into account non-monetized services/goods (mothers staying home to take care of children)

## Gross National Product
- Total market value of production by all of the national factors of production
- GNP = GDP + NFP
    - Net Factor Payments (NFP): income earned abroad by a nation's factors minus income earned in a nation by foreign factors

## Saving Identities and formulas
Saving = current income - current spending
### Private disposable income
- Yd = private disposable income = income that households are able to spend = income received from all sources, less tax = GDP + NFP + TR+ INT -T
    - INT = Interest rates on government debt
    - TR = Net Transfers (balance of unrequited transfers between residents and rest of the world. e.g remittances from individuals working abroad to their family back home)
    - T = Tax
- Yd = Y + NFP + TR + INT -T
### Private savings
Spvt = private disposable income (Yd) - consumption (C) = (Y + NFP + TR + INT - T) - C
### Government savings
Sgovt = net government income - government purchases = (T - TR - INT) - G
if Sgovt < 0, then gov has budget deficit
### National saving
S = Spvt + Sgovt =  (Y + NFP + TR + INT -T - C) + (T - TR - INT - G) = Y + NFP - C - G
National Savings =  Total income - total spending of economy
S = (C+I+G+NX) +NFP -C -G = I + NX + NFP
### International components in savings
Current Account: payments received from abroad less payments made to foreign countries by domestic economy  
CA = NX + NFP  
hence,  
S = I + + CA
### Uses of saving identity
S =  Spvt + Sgovt = I + CA
Spvt = I - Sgovyt + CA

## Saving vs Wealth (Measurement Type)
- Flow variable: calculated over a period of time  
- Stock variable: calculated at a point in time  
- Wealth: difference between an agent's asset & liabilities  
- National Wealth = total wealth of residents of a country =  domestic physical assets + net foreign assets
- Net foreign assets = foreign financial & physical assets - foreign liabilities 

## Real vs Nominal
Real: measured in terms current market value
Nominal: measured in terms of current market values

### Accounting for inflation
Inflation rate: percentage increase in price level over a period of time
$\pi_{t+1}$ = $(P_{t+1}-P_t)$/$P_t$ = $\delta P $/$P_t$
### Measuring inflation
- Price index: measure of average level of prices for some specified set of goods and services relative to the prices in a specified base year
### Commonly used indices
1. GDP deflator: price index that measure the overall level of price of goods and services included in GDP
    - GDP deflator =  nominal GDP/ real GDP
2. Consumer price index (CPI): measures changes in prices of subset of consumer goods, a fixed basket of goods, relative to base reference period
3. Chain Fisher volume index: combination index which changes the base price and chains across time.
    Steps:
    1. Calculate Fixed Weighter (Laspeyres Volume Index) = (GDP at Year<sub>t+1</sub> at Year<sub>t</sub> prices)/(GDP at Year<sub>t</sub> at Year<sub>t</sub> prices)
    2. Calculate Current Weighted (Paasche Volume Index) = (GDP at Year<sub>t+1</sub> at Year<sub>t+1</sub> prices)/(GDP at Year<sub>t</sub> at Year<sub>t+1</sub> prices)
    3. Fisher Volume Index = (Laspreyres Index * Paasche Index)<sup>1/2</sup>
4. Gives the real growth of GDP between the periods indicated

### Issues with Consumer Price Index & real GDP
1. Basket become outdated
2.  Goods may not exist then & do now
3. Historical measures of real GDP often have to be recalculated for any comparison

## Interest Rates
- Rate of return promised by a borrower to a lender
    - Nominal Interest Rate (i): rate which is agreed upon between borrower and lender
    - Real Interest Rate (r): rate at which the real value of the asset increase over time
